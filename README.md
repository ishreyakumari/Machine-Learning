*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
# 1.Predicting results using Linear regression
(Branch name -Linear_Regression) This is the project of analyzing Boston and Diabetes and predicting results using Linear regression. Steps include data cleaning,analysing and predicting results.
- Machine Learning (Linear Regression)
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

# 2.Full analysis of Titanic dataset
(Branch name -Titanic_dataset_analysis) This is the project of analyzing Titanic dataset to predict how many people are survived. It contains analysis of each column and comparing with other columns to extract maximum information about each passenger. Analysis is done by various charts and graphs to see clarity and loopholes in data. After analysing data, rectifying or removal of columns are being done. Finally prediction of survival is done by using 'Logistic Regression' and results has been shown with accuracy.
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

# 3.Full analysis of Iris dataset
(Branch name -Iris_dataset_analysis) This is the project of analyzing Iris dataset to predict the classes of each petal. It contains analysis of each column and comparing with other columns to extract maximum information about each petal. Analysis is done by various charts and graphs to see clarity and loopholes in data. After analysing data, rectifying or removal of columns are being done. Finally prediction of class is done by using 'K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm' and results has been shown with accuracy and confusion matrix.
