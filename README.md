# 2.Full analysis of Titanic dataset
(Branch - https://github.com/ishreyakumari/Machine-Learning/tree/Titanic_dataset_analysis) This is the project of analyzing Titanic dataset to predict how many people are survived. It contains analysis of each column and comparing with other columns to extract maximum information about each passenger. Analysis is done by various charts and graphs to see clarity and loopholes in data. After analysing data, rectifying or removal of columns are being done. Finally prediction of survival is done by using 'Logistic Regression' and results has been shown with accuracy.

# 3.Full analysis of Iris dataset
(Branch - https://github.com/ishreyakumari/Machine-Learning/tree/Iris_dataset_analysis) This is the project of analyzing Iris dataset to predict the classes of each petal. It contains analysis of each column and comparing with other columns to extract maximum information about each petal. Analysis is done by various charts and graphs to see clarity and loopholes in data. After analysing data, rectifying or removal of columns are being done. Finally prediction of class is done by using 'K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm' and results has been shown with accuracy and confusion matrix.

# 5.Full analysis of BigMart sales prediction dataset
(Branch - https://github.com/ishreyakumari/Machine-Learning/tree/Bigmart_sales_analysis) This is the project of analyzing 2013 Sales dataset containing 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities to predict sales of each product at a particular store. It contains analysis of each column and comparing with other columns to extract maximum information about each store. Analysis is done by various charts and graphs to see clarity and loopholes in data. Steps include import libraries, load datset, preprocessing, remove null, log transformation, correlation, label encoding, one hot encoding and splitting data. Finally prediction of 'item outlet sales' is done by using 'LASSO Regression' and results has been shown with accuracy, cv score, mean squared error and confusion matrix.

# 6.Full analysis of Boston housing prediction dataset
(Branch - https://github.com/ishreyakumari/Machine-Learning/tree/Boston_housing_analysis) This is the project of analyzing 1978 house prices dataset containing 506 entries with 14 attributes to predict median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's. It contains analysis of each column and comparing with other columns to extract maximum information about each store. Analysis is done by various charts and graphs to see clarity and loopholes in data. Steps include import libraries, load datset, preprocessing, standarization, correlation, and splitting data. Finally prediction of 'Median value of owner-occupied homes(medv)' is done by using 'XGBoost' and results has been shown with accuracy, cv score and mean squared error.
