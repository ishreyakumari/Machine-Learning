*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
# 1.Predicting results using Linear regression
(Branch name -Linear_Regression) This is the project of analyzing Boston and Diabetes and predicting results using Linear regression. Steps include data cleaning,analysing and predicting results.
- Machine Learning (Linear Regression)
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

# 2.Full analysis of Titanic dataset
(Branch name -Titanic_dataset_analysis) This is the project of analyzing Titanic dataset to predict how many people are survived. It contains analysis of each column and comparing with other columns to extract maximum information about each passenger. Analysis is done by various charts and graphs to see clarity and loopholes in data. After analysing data, rectifying or removal of columns are being done. Finally prediction of survival is done by using 'Logistic Regression' and results has been shown with accuracy.
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

# 3.Full analysis of Iris dataset
(Branch name -Iris_dataset_analysis) This is the project of analyzing Iris dataset to predict the classes of each petal. It contains analysis of each column and comparing with other columns to extract maximum information about each petal. Analysis is done by various charts and graphs to see clarity and loopholes in data. After analysing data, rectifying or removal of columns are being done. Finally prediction of class is done by using 'K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm' and results has been shown with accuracy and confusion matrix.

# 4.Full analysis of Loan prediction dataset
(Branch name -Loan_predition_analysis) This is the project of analyzing Loan dataset containing all details about each applicant to predict how many people's loan request got approved. It contains analysis of each column and comparing with other columns to extract maximum information about each applicant. Analysis is done by various charts and graphs to see clarity and loopholes in data. Steps include import libraries, load datset, preprocessing, remove null, log transformation, correlation, label encoding, splitting data. Finally prediction of 'loan status' is done by using 'Random Forest algorithm' and results has been shown with accuracy and confusion matrix.

# 5.Full analysis of BigData sales prediction dataset
(Branch name -Bigdata_sales_analysis) This is the project of analyzing 2013 Sales dataset containing 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities to predict sales of each product at a particular store. It contains analysis of each column and comparing with other columns to extract maximum information about each store. Analysis is done by various charts and graphs to see clarity and loopholes in data. Steps include import libraries, load datset, preprocessing, remove null, log transformation, correlation, label encoding, one hot encoding and splitting data. Finally prediction of 'item outlet sales' is done by using 'Random Forest algorithm' and results has been shown with accuracy, cv score, mean squared error and confusion matrix.
